# Language_learning 

A few words about this application! The following repetition algorithm
is applied here - when you have learned a word, you press the
&quot;learned&quot; button and the card will appear in your deck only
after 6 days. When it seems to you that it is worth repeating a word,
you click &quot;repeat&quot; and the card will appear the next day,
and if you could not learn the word, then click on &quot;learn&quot;
and the card will appear the next day in the same way. The interval of
learned cards will increase every time.Good Luck!
